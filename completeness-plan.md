# TCB-completeness checklist

What this document is: a tick-box accounting of how much of Mario's
declarative specification of Lean's type theory our TCB encodes. The
specification is `VEnv.IsDefEq` (Figure 1 of the lean4lean paper, implemented
in `Lean4Lean/Theory/Typing/Basic.lean`) plus the inductive and quotient
extensions added via `t-extra`.

## Status as of arena dry-run (2026-06)

Running the kernel against the full Lean Kernel Arena tutorial corpus + the
14 named singletons (143 tests total) via the new `scripts/arena-check.sh`
wrapper gives:

| outcome | count | meaning |
|--------:|------:|---------|
| ✅ accept | 54 | full pipeline (tcb + freeze + derived + final-checks) accepts |
| 🩹 holes  | 62 | only unfilled HOLEs blocked acceptance (43% of the corpus) |
| 🤷 shrug  | 19 | generator declined to represent the env |
| ❌ fail   | 8  | `.full.elf` rejected even without freeze (concrete error / fail-on-purpose) |
| 💥 sound  | 1  | **bad-test wrongly accepted: `tutorial/bad/066_BogusRecursor`** |

The 1 💥 is the original headline finding. A subsequent
soundness-regression refresh (commit `e43b96d Add more soundness checks`)
added three more adversarial `.elf` files in `lf/soundness/` to widen the
audit: **`large-elim-prop.elf`** (a closed proof of `defeq P Q : Prop`
constructed via large-elim + proof-irrel + iota), **`universe-too-high-
field.elf`** (a ctor with a field-universe exceeding the inductive's,
the Girard-paradox doorway), and **`rec-name-slot.elf`** (the `<ind>.rec`
slot squatted by a non-recursor). The first two are true soundness gaps;
the third is a spec-compliance gap with no False-route. All three are
currently **accepted by the TCB**, alongside `066_BogusRecursor`. Detailed
fix designs are in §3.1 (recursor-type, rolls in large-elim), §3.2
(field-universe), and §3.3 (rec-name).

This was previously framed in §3 / §7.3 as a "we trust the export" choice
under the assumption that the export is trustworthy. The arena's threat
model includes adversarial exports, so what was incomplete-but-defensible
under the prior framing is now demonstrated-unsound on four independent
adversarial inputs: bringing the missing checks inside the TCB is the
**#0 priority** (above the existing completeness gaps, which are at worst
loss-of-completeness).

The wrapper, the YAML submission, and the standalone-soundness mapping
(✅ → exit 0, 🩹/🤷/🔴 → exit 2, ❌/fail-on-purpose → exit 1) are documented
in `arena-submission-plan.md`. A CI smoke test (`.github/workflows/main.yml`
job `arena-smoke`) drives `arena-check.sh` against `tutorial/001_basicDef`
(expects 0) and `tutorial/002_badDef` (expects 1) on every push, guarding
the arena interface against regression.

**What "TCB-complete" means here.** For every defeq fact that holds in Mario's
declarative relation, there exists an inhabitant of the corresponding LF type
in our signature. **Translator-completeness is a separate question**: given a
TCB-complete signature, can our translator find the witness? We are explicitly
OK with the translator failing to find proofs (it's a heuristic search), as
long as the witness exists for someone or something else — human, LLM,
decision procedure — to construct.

## 1. The core defeq judgment (paper Figure 1)

Mario's judgment is `Γ ⊢_{E,n} e ≡ e' : α`, with implicit reflexivity
(`Γ ⊢ e : α` defined as `Γ ⊢ e ≡ e : α`). We map this onto our
`defeq E1 E2 A`, treating the LF context as the typing context (each
`{x : expr} defeq x x A -> ...` binder corresponds to a `Γ, x : α` extension).

### 1.1 Detail on `t-const` partial coverage

Mario's full rule:

> Given `ū.(c_ū : α) ∈ E` and `∀i. n ⊢ ℓᵢ, ℓ'ᵢ ok ∧ ℓᵢ ≡ ℓ'ᵢ`, conclude
> `Γ ⊢ c_{ℓ̄} ≡ c_{ℓ̄'} : α[ū ↦ ℓ̄]`.

The `ℓᵢ ≡ ℓ'ᵢ` premise means the two instantiations can be different level
expressions, provided they're defeq as levels. Our `defeq/const`:

```
defeq/const :
   declared N LS T DK W
   -> defeq (econst N LS) (econst N LS) T.
```

handles only the `ℓᵢ = ℓ'ᵢ` diagonal (same `LS` on both sides). To get
`defeq (econst N LS) (econst N LS') T` for `lvls-eq LS LS'`, we'd need either:

- a new rule
  `defeq/const-lvl-cong : declared N LS T DK W -> lvls-eq LS LS' -> defeq (econst N LS) (econst N LS') T'`
  (where T' is T with LS substituted), or
- prove `lvls-eq` lifts through `defeq` via the structural congruence on
  `defeq` (probably not directly possible without the rule).

**Practical impact**: any time the same polymorphic constant appears with
provably-equal-but-not-syntactically-equal level args on two sides of a defeq,
we can't close the gap. Example: `id.{max u v} α` vs `id.{max v u} α` — these
are the same in Mario's spec but our TCB can't witness it.

### 1.2 Detail on the missing `t-extra` cases

Mario's `t-extra` is the catch-all environment-provided equality rule. Iota,
structural eta, and Quot's primitive rule are all added via `t-extra` in the
formalization. Each is a fixed family of equations parameterized by the
inductive declaration. In LF this becomes one rule per (inductive, applicable
operation) pair — there's no encoding-level obstacle, just bookkeeping (and a
coupling-to-defeq concern when the rule is supposed to fire modulo whnf).

Specifically:

- **Iota for `Foo.rec`**: one rule per `(Foo, ctor_k)` pair, of shape
  `defeq (Foo.rec ... (Foo.ctor_k a₁...aₘ)) <body-using-args> α`.
  Pattern-matching on the ctor head is standard LF.

- **Structural eta for one-ctor `Foo`**: one rule per such `Foo`, of shape
  `defeq (Foo.mk (π₁ x) ... (π_n x)) x Foo`. Requires the TCB to identify the
  ctor and the projection set, which we currently don't track explicitly.

- **Quot's primitive rule**: `defeq (Quot.lift f h (Quot.mk r a)) (f a) α`.
  One rule, hardcoded for the four `Quot.*` constants.

## 2. Level equality (`lvl-eq`) completeness

Mario's `ℓ ≡ ℓ'` is _extensional_: defined by `⟦ℓ⟧_v = ⟦ℓ'⟧_v` for every
assignment `v : ℕ → ℕ` of nat values to universe variables (`VLevel.Equiv` in
the formalization).

**Status: closed by the `mleq` decision procedure (May 2026).** The old
reactive table of `lvl-eq` algebraic rules has been replaced by a port of
**Carneiro's algorithmic level inequality** (Type Theory of Lean thesis, p.7):
the offset relation `mleq L L' N` (⟦L⟧ ≤ ⟦L'⟧ + N for every valuation), with
`lvl-eq L L'` recovered as two-sided `mleq L L' 0 ∧ mleq L' L 0` (`lvl-eq/le`).
It is the inference-rule algorithm (searchable/checkable), NOT the semantic
`VLevel.Equiv`. `lvl-eq` now has only `refl` (the syntactic primitive) and `le`
(the `mleq` bridge); no algebraic or congruence rules remain.

The 15 structural rules (the thesis' 13 + the two RHS `imax` simplification
duals `imax-lzR`/`imax-lsR`, needed once an offset puts the imax on the right)
decide the variable-free fragment — associativity, commutativity,
distributivity, and the max/imax zero/succ/idempotence laws the old table had
to special-case. The prover (`synth.ts`, `proveMleq`) supplies a concrete
integer offset at every step, so Twelf only *checks* ground `N±1` / `N >= 0`
constraints (the `enatlit` `nonneg` witness pattern), never solves for them.

**Universe variables: closed via first-order variable elimination.** The
thesis' 14th rule eliminates a universe variable by the case split `u ↦ 0` /
`u ↦ S u`. Earlier this was thought to require fragile HOAS (`mleq (LF U)(LG U)
N` with a degenerate higher-order unification `LF U = a`). But our level
variables are **first-order de Bruijn indices** (`lvar : lidx -> lvl`), so the
case split is encoded directly as `mleq/var-elim` using a first-order
substitution judgment `lvl-subst` and structurally-decidable index
(dis)equality `lidx-eq` / `lidx-neq` (no posit-and-audit — unlike strings,
`lidx` disequality is a genuine closed judgment). Soundness: `lvar I` ranges
over ℕ = {0} ∪ {S k}, so a goal holding with `I ↦ 0` and with `I ↦ S I` (whose
still-free `I` is the predecessor) holds for every valuation; the substitution
is exact by construction, so the rule has no loophole. The prover (`proveMleq`
→ `proveVarElim`) detects a variable blocking as an `imax` second argument,
case-splits it, and recurses. This reaches e.g. `imax (imax u u) u ≡
imax (succ u) u` (Peano tests 023–025). `mleq` is now complete for the full
fragment; 36 corpus tests prove sort equalities via the structural rules, the 3
Peano tests via `var-elim`.

## 3. Inductive-type acceptance (orthogonal to defeq)

Lean's kernel performs structural checks on inductive declarations that are
NOT part of `IsDefEq`. They live in our TCB as separate closed families.

elaboration, whereas our TCB re-derives neither — it accepts whatever recursor
type and field universes the input supplies. That is a **soundness gap, full
stop**, not a defensible trust choice: the kernel is supposed to validate these
itself, and the arena's whole purpose is to feed it inputs that violate them.
`066_BogusRecursor` (§3.1) is a concrete input the TCB wrongly accepts;
`large-elim-prop` (`lf/soundness/`) drives the recursor gap all the way to a
proof of `False`. Bringing recursor well-formedness and universe consistency
*inside* the TCB is required, not optional. "The input is well-formed" is an
assumption we explicitly reject.

The `lf/soundness/` adversarial corpus and `scripts/check-soundness.sh` are
the audit instruments; each `.elf` carries an `Expected outcome: ABORT`
header and a comment explaining the attack. The table below is the
current scoreboard (updated as fixes land; verify with a fresh
`check-soundness.sh` run before quoting).

(a) After §3.2's partial landing, the hand-written attacks use the *old*
`dkind-ok/ctor` signature (no `field-universes-ok-skip-params` premise),
which no longer type-checks — so they ABORT, but for the schematic reason
that the file is out-of-date, not because the field-universe check fires
on them.  An updated `large-elim-prop.elf` that supplies the new ctor
premises would re-expose §3.1's recursor-type gap; the field-universe
check is orthogonal to large-elim soundness.  See §3.2.1 for the
post-§3.2 state.

(b) Generator-emitted `.full.elf` for these arena tests supplies the new
`dkind-ok/ctor` premises, but the `field-universes-ok-skip-params` slot
is a HOLE on a frozen family (the prover-side fuo synthesis isn't yet
implemented), so the ctor declines.  For a bad test, decline counts as
correct rejection from the arena's perspective.

**rec-name-slot vs. rec-slot-theft: what the pair tells us (§3.3).**
The TCB already catches a *different* rec-slot attack via `%unique name`:
`rec-slot-theft.elf` reserves `name "Foo.rec" (is-rec-for "Foo")`
alongside the inductive, then tries to also declare
`name "Foo.rec" (is-decl T (defn V))` — two `nkind`s for the same
string, so `%unique name` aborts the load.  That mechanism is sound
*provided the reservation is in place*.  `rec-name-slot.elf` is the
inductive that *omits* the reservation; nothing collides, and the
junk `def Foo.rec` is accepted.

So the §3.3 fix isn't "add string concat" — it's the weaker but
sufficient: **require `declared/ok-indt` to take a `name MRec (is-rec-for
N)` premise.**  Then no inductive can be declared without *some*
rec-name reservation, the translator picks a canonical `<ind>.rec` by
convention, and `def <ind>.rec` then collides with that reservation
exactly the way `rec-slot-theft` already exercises.  A malicious
translator that picks a non-canonical MRec doesn't get a False-route
either — the env just has a non-standard recursor name, with `def
<ind>.rec` as an unrelated definition.  Concrete plan moved to §3.3.

**The two arena `imax`-disguised tests are *the same gap classes* as §3.1
and §3.2** — they exploit a translator-side preflight bypass
(`levelToNumber` doesn't normalize `imax 1 1 → 1` or `imax 1 0 → 0`), so the
generator's gate misclassifies the sort and skips the check.  The TCB-side
fixes in §3.1/§3.2 use `mleq` (Carneiro's algorithmic level inequality,
§7.1), which handles `imax` natively — so closing §3.1 and §3.2 closes
all four corresponding tests, not just the syntactic ones.  A translator-
side `normalizeLevel` shim before `levelToNumber` would also close them,
but that's a stopgap; the architectural move is to bring the check into
the TCB so the translator's preflight cleverness is no longer load-bearing.

### 3.1 Recursor-type soundness gap (the `066_BogusRecursor` finding)

**The attack.** The arena test
`lean-kernel-arena/_build/tests/tutorial/bad/066_BogusRecursor.ndjson`
declares a one-ctor inductive

```lean
inductive BogusRecursor : Type where
  | mk : BogusRecursor
```

and then asserts `BogusRecursor.rec : Sort 0` (i.e. `Prop`). A genuine
Lean export would synthesize the recursor type
`{motive : BogusRecursor → Sort u} → motive mk → (t : BogusRecursor) → motive t`
during elaboration. The bogus one just hands back `Prop`.

**Why the TCB lets it through.** The relevant rule (`lf/tcb.elf`):

```twelf
dkind-ok/irec :
   defeq T T (esort U) -> dkind-ok irec T.
```

This is only "T is *some* well-formed type". `Prop` qualifies, so the rule
fires and `declared "BogusRecursor.rec" (esort lzero) irec` is admitted.
The freeze step accepts it (the obligation has been discharged), and the
load completes. The `%unique name` check at `final-checks.elf` doesn't help
either — `name "BogusRecursor.rec" (is-rec-for "BogusRecursor")` is exactly
the reservation the inductive's emission makes.

**Two viable fixes, in increasing order of TCB ambition.**

*Fix A — translator-synthesized canonical schema, checked TCB-side via
`defeq`.* The translator already knows how to build the canonical recursor
type from the inductive's payload (it would have to, to dispatch iota
rules). Make it emit the canonical type `T_canon` alongside `T_supplied`
and a `defeq T_supplied T_canon (esort U)` witness. Then `dkind-ok/irec`
takes the defeq witness as a premise rather than just well-formedness:

```twelf
dkind-ok/irec :
   defeq T T_canon (esort U)
   -> rec-schema-canonical N T_canon  %% closed LF judgment
   -> dkind-ok irec T.
```

The work is in `rec-schema-canonical`: a closed LF family that constructs
the canonical recursor type from `declared "<ind>" Ts indt` + the ctor
declarations. This is structurally large (motive binder, per-ctor minor
premises with field IHs, major premise, result), but bounded — Mario's
spec gives the recipe explicitly. The translator is untrusted for this
construction: if it lies about `T_canon`, `rec-schema-canonical` won't
inhabit, and the load fails.

*Fix B — make recursor declaration not a `declared/ok-irec` at all.*
Inductive emission already knows everything it needs. Replace
`declared "<ind>.rec" T irec` with a derived family `rec-declared
"<ind>.rec" "<ind>" T` whose only inhabitant comes from a rule that takes
the inductive's `declared` witness, the ctor witnesses, and **builds T
position-by-position** — no `T_supplied` ever crosses the boundary. The
recursor's type ceases to be a translator input and becomes a derivation
output. Cleaner soundness story; bigger refactor (every existing iota rule
that pattern-matches `declared <rec> T irec` would migrate).

Fix A is the path of least disruption and lands soundness in a
self-contained edit to `dkind-ok/irec` + a new `rec-schema-canonical`
family. Fix B is the asymptotically right design but pulls in the recursor
across every iota-stage rule we eventually add.

**Sibling attack: `large-elim-prop.elf`.** Same root cause, different symptom.
The hand-written `lf/soundness/large-elim-prop.elf` declares
`inductive PropTwo : Prop | a | b`, then asserts a Bool-style recursor whose
motive's universe is `Type 0`. The TCB's `dkind-ok/irec` accepts it (the type
*is* well-formed at some sort). Combined with `defeq/proof-irrel`
(`a ≡ b : PropTwo : Prop` because both are proofs of the same Prop) and the
existing `defeq/iota-enum-2-*` rules, the file derives a closed witness
`boom : defeq P Q (esort lzero)` for two distinct axioms `P`, `Q : Prop` —
that's the inconsistency. So `dkind-ok/irec` must enforce *both* (a) the
recursor type matches the canonical schema and (b) the motive universe `U`
is eligible (Prop inductives with ≥2 ctors may only large-eliminate when `U
= lzero`). One premise covers both:

```twelf
dkind-ok/irec :
   declared IndN (esort UInd) indt
   -> rec-schema-canonical IndN UInd U T   %% T = canonical recursor type for
                                            %% IndN at sort UInd eliminating to U;
                                            %% relation enforces LE-eligibility
                                            %% when UInd = lzero & ≥2 ctors
   -> dkind-ok irec T.
```

Building `rec-schema-canonical` is the major piece of work. Lean's spec gives
the recipe; the LF transliteration is bounded (one rule per "shape" — enum,
recursive enum, params, indices, etc.). The existing `enum-rec-type` in
`tcb.elf` is the 1-3-ctor-enum case of this family and serves as the
prototype.

**Regression.** Both `066_BogusRecursor.full.elf` (already auto-generated
from the arena) and `lf/soundness/large-elim-prop.elf` (already
hand-written) will flip from 💥 to ✅ as soon as `rec-schema-canonical` is
in place. Add `lf/soundness/bogus-recursor.elf` if you want a hand-written
mirror of the 066 attack independent of the generator (currently the only
trace is the auto-generated `lf/tests/066_BogusRecursor.full.elf`).

**Cost of the fix.** 98 of 143 arena tests currently exercise
`declared/ok-irec` (and so flow through `dkind-ok/irec`); 31 of those are
currently ✅. The fix requires that every admitted recursor come with a
canonical-schema witness, which means `rec-schema-canonical` must cover
every inductive shape we admit (today: the `enum-rec-type` recognizer
only handles 1-3 ctor enums with no params and no rec args). Until the
canonical-schema family is extended to match every iota-supported shape
(and stage 2+ shapes whose recursors we admit but don't iota on), the
fix will convert a number of currently-✅ tests into 🩹 (decline). Net
the right trade — the TCB stops admitting recursors it can't audit — but
worth flagging that the immediate arena-accept count will fall before
the completeness work catches it back up.

### 3.2 Ctor field-universe gap (the `universe-too-high-field.elf` finding)

**The attack.** `lf/soundness/universe-too-high-field.elf` declares
`inductive TooHigh : Type 0 | mk (a : Type 0) : TooHigh`. The field `a`'s
type `Type 0` lives at `Sort 1`, but the inductive itself is at `Sort 1`
(`Type 0`). Lean's rule (`l2 ≤ l` in `lean.mm1`'s `ctor_Pi`) demands each
field's sort be ≤ the inductive's sort; here it isn't, so Lean rejects.

This is the classic doorway to Girard's paradox — once you can pack types
into smaller universes via a constructor, a closed proof of `False` is a
few rules away. The hand-written file stops short of actually building the
False proof; the TCB accepting the declaration is enough to demonstrate the
gap.

**Why the TCB lets it through.** `lf/tcb.elf:dkind-ok/ctor` checks only that
the ctor type is well-formed at *some* sort plus `ctor-positive`. There is
no premise relating any field's sort to the inductive's:

```twelf
dkind-ok/ctor :
   defeq T T (esort U) -> ctor-positive ... T -> dkind-ok ctor T.
```

`U` is the ctor type's sort, not the inductive's. Nothing in the rule
chases through the Π chain of `T` to bound each domain's sort.

**Proposed fix.** Add a `field-universes-ok T UInd` premise that walks `T`'s
Π chain and, for each field domain `D`, demands `mleq sortOf(D) UInd 0`
(D's sort ≤ inductive's sort, per §7.1's algorithmic level inequality).
The inductive's sort `UInd` is recovered from the parent inductive's
`declared` witness:

```twelf
dkind-ok/ctor :
   declared IndN (esort UInd) indt
   -> defeq T T (esort UCtor)
   -> ctor-positive IndN _ T
   -> field-universes-ok T UInd     %% new: each field's sort ≤ UInd
   -> dkind-ok ctor T.

field-universes-ok : expr -> lvl -> type.
field-universes-ok/result :
   field-universes-ok (econst _ _) _.    %% reached the result type — done
field-universes-ok/forall :
   defeq D D (esort UD)                    %% domain's sort UD
   -> mleq UD UInd 0                       %% UD ≤ UInd (§7.1)
   -> ({x:expr} field-universes-ok (B x) UInd)
   -> field-universes-ok (eforall D B) UInd.
```

The recursion in `field-universes-ok/forall` walks under the LF binder, so
each field's `(esort UD)` is computed at the point that field is introduced.
The `mleq UD UInd 0` premise is the algorithmic level-inequality from
§7.1 (already implemented per `Complete mleq …` in commit history) —
reused, no new level machinery.

`Prop` (sort `lzero`) is its own special case via the standard
`l2 ≤_imax l` impredicativity rule; that drops out of `mleq`'s `imax` cases
without a separate Prop carve-out.

**Cost.** Tighter than §3.1: a single new judgment + one new premise on
`dkind-ok/ctor`. Existing tests that already satisfy the universe constraint
(the entire arena's good corpus — Lean's elaborator ensures this) stay
green. The only new failures are translator outputs where the env is
already malformed, which is exactly the desired behavior. The fix should
require ~50 LF lines + a translator update to emit
`field-universes-ok` witnesses (the translator can synthesize them
mechanically by recursing on the ctor type).

### 3.2.1 Status as of 2026-06-03 — partial landing

**Landed in this session.** `lf/tcb.elf` now carries
`ends-in-sort-with-level`, `not-forall`, `field-universes-ok`, and
`field-universes-ok-skip-params`. `dkind-ok/ctor` requires the new
premises. All four new families are frozen in `freeze.elf`. The translator
in `src/generate-twelf.ts` synthesizes the structural `eisl` witness
inline (a mechanical walk via `buildEisl`) and emits a bare-HOLE
declaration for the `fuo` witness on the now-frozen
`field-universes-ok-skip-params` family.

**Arena verdict after the change** (145 tests):

- Good: 25 ✅ / 58 🩹 / 10 ❌ — *28 previously-✅ tests dropped to 🩹*
  (the expected cost of the soundness ratchet; recovers when the fuo
  prover lands, below).
- Bad: 17 ✅ / 35 🩹 / **0 💥** — soundness gap closed on the corpus.
- Hand-written `lf/soundness/`: `universe-too-high-field.elf` aborts
  cleanly (the file uses the *old* `dkind-ok/ctor` signature, which no
  longer type-checks); `large-elim-prop.elf` also aborts for the same
  reason (its ctors fail the signature change), though §3.1's `rec-
  schema-canonical` is what actually closes the large-elim gap. (A file
  that updates the ctor invocations to the new signature would re-expose
  the large-elim soundness gap; the field-universes check is orthogonal.)
- `rec-name-slot.elf` still 💥 — §3.3 work, not on this critical path.

**Still open: fuo prover (planned for the next session).** The HOLE on
every ctor's `fuo` is what's dropping 28 good tests. To recover them, a
new Prover method (`fieldUniverses`) walks the ctor type, synthesizes
each field's `defeq A A (esort UA)` via existing `synth.synthRec`
machinery, and accumulates `mleq UA UInd 0` subgoals to be emitted as
top-level `%solve` directives (mleq is decidable per §7.1; closed level
expressions only, so the %solve never depends on LF binders).

The prover's job is structural with one moving piece — the recursion
under LF binders for each Π — and Twelf's `%solve` handles the per-field
`mleq` cheaply.  Estimated: a day's work in `synth.ts`, plus the wiring
through `prover.ts` + a small generator change to emit the witness
inline instead of a HOLE.

### 3.3 Recursor-name slot (the `rec-name-slot.elf` finding)

**The attack.** `lf/soundness/rec-name-slot.elf` declares `inductive Foo`
*without* reserving `name "Foo.rec" (is-rec-for "Foo")` — only the trusted
generator emits that reservation; a hand-written file may omit it — then
declares `def Foo.rec : Type 0 := Foo`. The TCB accepts; Lean rejects (the
recursor slot is reserved by elaboration regardless of source-text).

**Not a soundness bug.** The resulting environment has a definition named
`Foo.rec` and an inductive `Foo` with no recursor. That's weird but it
doesn't construct a proof of False. The motivation to fix it is
spec-compliance: every Lean env our TCB admits should be one Lean would
also admit.

**What the rec-slot-theft regression already buys us.** A *companion*
hand-written file `lf/soundness/rec-slot-theft.elf` is already passing
(rejected): it declares `inductive Foo` *and* a rec-name reservation
`name "Foo.rec" (is-rec-for "Foo")`, then attempts to declare a junk
`def Foo.rec` whose `name "Foo.rec" (is-decl T (defn V))` clashes with
the reservation under `%unique name +N -K`.  Two different `nkind`s for
the same string → ABORT.  So the global mechanism that catches the attack
is *already in place* in the TCB; what's missing is the guarantee that
the rec-name reservation always exists at all.

That reframes the problem.  We don't need to *constrain the rec-name
string* to be `<ind>.rec` (which would require LF-level string concat —
see "String-concat in LF" below for why that's a dead end).  We only need
to **require that an inductive's declaration come with some `is-rec-for`
reservation**.  The translator emits the canonical `<ind>.rec` by
convention; `%unique` does the rest.

**Concrete fix.**  Split `declared/ok` into a separate
`declared/ok-indt` (parallel to the existing `declared/ok-irec`) that
takes the rec-name reservation as a premise:

```twelf
declared/ok-indt :
   name N (is-decl T indt)
   -> name MRec (is-rec-for N)         %% rec-name slot reserved (some MRec)
   -> dkind-ok indt T
   -> declared N T indt.
```

`MRec` is a translator-chosen string.  The premise demands *some*
`is-rec-for N` reservation exists; without one, no `declared N T indt`
witness can be constructed and the inductive declaration is rejected.
That closes `rec-name-slot.elf` directly — Foo declares no reservation,
so no `declared "Foo" _ indt` is provable.

**What this does *not* close.**  A malicious translator that picks
`MRec = "FooWeirdName"` (not the canonical "Foo.rec") would still get
through, with the env's recursor slot at the weird name and `def
Foo.rec` proceeding as an unrelated definition.  That's *not* a
False-route: the kernel doesn't perform iota-reduction on `def
Foo.rec` because it isn't reserved as a recursor; the env is just
internally inconsistent with Lean's naming convention.  Spec-compliance
loss, soundness preserved.

**Why we don't pursue full canonicality.**  Pinning `MRec = "<N>.rec"`
in pure LF would require a `string-cat` family with a `%query`-style
audit, paralleling §3's `string-neq` discipline.  But unlike
`string-neq` (where `%query 0 * string-neq X X` decides the audit by
reflexive pattern-match, no string introspection required), a posited
`string-cat N ".rec" M` claim is *unverifiable* without inspecting the
strings' characters.  We can't catch a lie like
`string-cat "Foo" ".rec" "FooWeirdName"` with a closed Twelf query.
Bringing real string structure into the TCB (strings as cons-lists of
characters) would solve it but is a major refactor with pervasive
fallout.  The translator-side audit ("the trusted generator emits
canonical `<ind>.rec`") is what we lean on instead.

**Recommendation.**  Land `declared/ok-indt` with the rec-name premise
alongside §3.1's `dkind-ok/ctor` restructure (they both touch
`declared`-family rules).  Cost: ~10 LF lines, one matching change in
the translator (emit `Foo/decl = declared/ok-indt Foo/name Foo/rec-name
(dkind-ok/indt …)`), audit `generate-twelf.ts` to confirm the canonical
rec-name reservation is always emitted.  Result: `rec-name-slot.elf`
ABORTs, the canonical-name story stays "translator-audited" without
needing string concat, and the `rec-slot-theft` mechanism keeps
catching the dual attack as before.

## 4. Other things in Mario's spec that aren't defeq rules

Mario's `Theory.Typing.Basic` and `Theory.Inductive` files also encode:

- **`Δ ⊢ Γ ok`** (context well-formedness) — implicit in our LF context via
  the `{x : expr} defeq x x A -> ...` pattern. Adequate.
- **`n ⊢ ℓ ok`** (level-param index in range) — we don't carry this
  explicitly; level params appear under `{u : lvl}` LF binders and can't be
  misused. Adequate.
- **VEnv well-formedness** — each `declared` carries its own `dkind-ok` proof;
  the `%unique` seal enforces functional dependency on names. Equivalent to
  Mario's per-decl WF + global injectivity.

## 5. Honest gap list, ranked by impact

By "impact" I mean: how often does the corpus / a real Lean library exercise
this?

## Translator-side declines (formerly tcb-violation cases)

The LF encoding doesn't verify several kernel-level invariants that Lean
checks. When the translator detects one, it emits `%% SKIP:` and declines to
emit the offending declaration. **This is honestly tracked as INCOMPLETE
(🤷)** — not as a Twelf rejection, even when the .ndjson was supposed to be
rejected. Previously the translator emitted `%solve _ : tcb-violation.`
forcing a Twelf abort, which we counted as a "success" rejection; that was a
self-deception, since Twelf wasn't checking the actual soundness condition.

### Migrations completed: 🤷 → ✅ via genuine Twelf mechanisms

The following bad-test rejections were converted from translator-side declines
to Twelf-decided rejections this session (+10 bad ✅):

- **Duplicate names via `%unique declared`** (120, 121, 123, 125, 126). The
  TCB already has `%unique declared +N +LS -1T -1DK *W`. We now emit both
  clashing declarations with distinct LF mangles (`<base>` and
  `<base>__dup<n>`) but the same Lean-name string in the first arg of
  `declared`; `%unique` then catches the overlap during world-checking and
  ABORTs the file.

- **`%solve` on `ends-in-sort` for monomorphic inductives** (039, 040). When
  the translator's `endsInSortProof` returns null, we emit
  `%solve <mn>/ends-in-sort : ends-in-sort <T>.` instead of SKIPping. The
  `ends-in-sort` judgment is closed and decidable; Twelf's proof search
  succeeds for valid Π-chain-to-sort types and ABORTs otherwise. Polymorphic
  case still falls back to SKIP (would need %solve on closed instantiations).

- **`%solve` on `ctor-positive` for monomorphic head-mismatches** (049). When
  `buildCtorSpine` fails, we walk past leading Π binders to the result type
  and test whether `buildAppliesSelf` accepts the head. If not — i.e., the
  ctor's result-type head isn't the inductive at the right level instantiation
  — defer to Twelf via `%solve`. This is sound: `applies-self` only inhabits
  chains ending in `[S] S` (via `applies-self/refl`) or `[S] eapp (M S) E`
  (via `/app`, recursive), with no rule that fires on a constant or
  wrong-named head, so Twelf's search correctly aborts.

- **Level-substituted `%solve` for polymorphic head-mismatches** (045). The
  `inductWrongCtorResLevel` test has a ctor whose result uses swapped level
  params `[u2, u1]` against the inductive's declared `[u1, u2]`. Since
  `%solve` needs a closed goal, we substitute each level param `u_i` with a
  distinct concrete level (`lzero`, `lsucc lzero`, `lsucc lsucc lzero`, ...)
  via fresh `substLevel`/`substExprLevels` helpers, then emit `%solve` on the
  closed instance. Substitution preserves syntactic structure, so a head
  mismatch in the polymorphic original (the swapped levels) survives as a head
  mismatch in the substituted version (`[lsucc lzero, lzero]` vs
  `[lzero, lsucc lzero]`), and `%solve` correctly aborts.

- **Dup-aware downstream synth suppression** (122). The dup_ctor_def test has
  a defn and a ctor with the same Lean name. `%unique` would catch this, but a
  downstream recursor type-synth failure (caused by declTable's
  first-occurrence-wins lookup returning the defn's type when the recursor
  expects the ctor's type) was emitting a SKIP marker that masked the abort in
  the harness. When `dupCounter.size > 0`, the translator now emits a plain
  `%% (declined to emit ...)` comment for synth failures rather than
  `%% SKIP:`, letting `%unique` do its work.

### SAFELIST: encoding gaps Twelf fundamentally cannot represent under the current TCB

**Strict positivity for field-position negative occurrences (047, 050, 105,
plus 106 from a related universe-check fallback).** The TCB's
`ctor-positive/intro` rule is:

```
ctor-positive/intro :
   {T_HOAS : expr -> expr}
   ctor-spine T_HOAS
   -> ctor-positive N0 LS0 (T_HOAS (econst N0 LS0)).
```

The adequacy comment claims T*HOAS is \_the* canonical full-capture function
`(λS. T[N0 LS0 ↦ S])`. But nothing in the encoding enforces this — any T_HOAS
that reproduces T when applied to `(econst N0 LS0)` is accepted. Twelf's
higher-order pattern unification can pick a T_HOAS that leaves some
occurrences of `(econst N0 LS0)` unreplaced inside a sub-expression that's
then S-free as a function of `T_HOAS`'s argument, and `strict-pos/no-occur`
fires vacuously on the closed sub-expression to "prove" strict positivity of a
negative-occurrence ctor.

**Concrete witness Twelf finds for `mk : (I → I) → I`** (test 047):

```
T_HOAS = [e] eforall (eforall (econst I) ([x] econst I)) ([y] e)
```

Only the outer I is abstracted. The inner `eforall (econst I) ([x] econst I)`
— i.e., `I → I` — is closed (doesn't mention `e`), so `strict-pos/no-occur`
accepts it as a vacuously-positive "argument type", and the rest of
`ctor-spine` walks through unchecked.

`%solve` is **unsound** for `ctor-positive` whenever the failure is at
field-position. We detect this via `headIsApplicable` (walk past Π binders,
test `buildAppliesSelf` on the result): if the head IS applicable but
`buildCtorSpine` still fails, the failure must be a field strict-pos issue,
and we stay 🤷 rather than defer to Twelf.

**Pure-TCB fix DONE (May 2026).** `strict-pos` now carries the inductive's
name `N0`, and its absence leaves take a `no-self-ref N0 E` premise (likewise
the Π-domain of `strict-pos/forall`).  `no-self-ref` is a structural traversal
that, at each `econst N` leaf, demands `string-neq N N0`.  So the LF signature
itself — not the generator — bars a self-occurrence from any closed domain:
the under-abstracted `T_HOAS` above leaves `econst I` in the inner domain,
which now forces a `string-neq "I" "I"` obligation.

`no-self-ref/const`'s `N ≠ N0` decision is supplied without a Twelf string-
inequality domain (none ships in the limited-thaw build) by *faking*
disequality the same way the name→meaning functional dependency is faked: a
new OPEN family `string-neq : string -> string -> type` (thawed in
`freeze.elf`) lets an environment *posit* any disequalities its positivity
proofs need, and a global

```
%query 0 * string-neq X X.
```

in `final-checks.elf` ABORTs the whole load if any posited pair is reflexive.
Honest claims (`a ≠ b`) never match `X X`; a lie (`a = a`) sinks the
development.  Net effect: `T_HOAS` correctness is no longer a soundness
condition — a wrong/adversarial `T_HOAS` or spine can only lose completeness (a
HOLE), never fake positivity.  `ctor-positive` is now sound *independent of the
generator* (only `tcb.elf` + `freeze.elf` + `final-checks.elf` + `parse.ts` +
`generate-twelf.ts` + `shared.ts` need auditing; `prover.ts`/`synth.ts` do
not).

Guarded by a hand-written regression:
`lf/soundness/positivity-underabstraction.elf` reconstructs the exact
under-abstraction attack on
`mk : (indNeg → Empty) → indNeg` and is rejected by `scripts/check-soundness.sh`
(the attack type-checks only by declaring `string-neq "indNeg" "indNeg"`, which
the global query then catches).  Note the new check is also *name-only* (any
level instantiation of `N0` counts as an occurrence), closing the related
latent gap where the old name+level `isSelfRef` ignored cross-level self-uses.

The still-deferred generalizations (mutual self-refs, nested inductives,
positivity modulo defeq) are unchanged — see the table rows above.

### Other translator-side declines still active

Each remains a 🤷 candidate for migration into Twelf-verified checks. They
need substantial TCB extensions:

- **numParams ≤ #leading Π in inductive type** (042). Would need `numParams`
  reified in LF (perhaps via a Peano `nat` and a `numparams-ok` judgment).
- **ctor result-type's first numParams args are the right param-binder bvars**
  (043, 044). `applies-self/app` accepts any arg expressions; we'd need a
  stricter `applies-self-bvar-spine` judgment that checks
  position-by-position.
- **ctor result-type's index args don't mention the inductive itself** (046).
  Needs an `s-free` syntactic predicate over Expr, integrated into the
  `applies-self`/`ctor-spine` chain at the right places.
- **concrete-case field universe ≤ inductive universe minus 1** (054). Needs
  universe arithmetic in LF.
- **large elimination from a ≥2-ctor Prop** (127). Gated translator-side
  (check (f)): a Prop inductive with ≥2 ctors whose recursor motive targets a
  non-Prop sort is rejected (SKIP). A pure-TCB fix would add an `le-ok` premise
  to `dkind-ok/irec` that reads the motive's target sort and checks
  subsingleton eligibility; needs universe comparison + ctor-field analysis in
  LF. The ≤1-ctor subsingleton case (Acc/Eq/Quot-style legitimate large elim)
  is currently admitted on typing alone.
- **projection-expression support** (009, 078, 079, 081, 083, 084, 085, 087,
  088, 104). Need `proj` constructor in the expr datatype and corresponding
  typing/reduction rules.

## Honest harness reporting

`check-tests.sh` reports good and bad tests separately:

```
Good (expected accept):  ✅ N1   ⚠️ N2   ❌ N3
Bad  (expected reject):  ✅ N4   ⚠️ N5   💥 N6
```

The bad ⚠️ column makes it visible when a translator-side decline is being
substituted for a Twelf-verified rejection. Bad ✅ counts bad tests Twelf
actually rejected via its LF-encoded checks.

**Current full-corpus snapshot** (143 tests, 2026-06 arena run):

- **Good (93 tests):** 53 ✅ / 30 🩹 / 10 ❌
- **Bad  (50 tests):** 17 ✅ / 32 🩹 / **1 💥** (`066_BogusRecursor` — see §3.1)
- All 3 hand-written soundness regressions in `lf/soundness/` are still
  correctly ABORTed.

The previously-celebrated "10 migrations" from translator-decline to
Twelf-decided rejection are still in place. The session that wrote the
arena-submission story did not regress them; it surfaced the BogusRecursor
gap that the prior corpus did not stress.

**For the arena interface specifically** (different verdict mapping; see
`arena-submission-plan.md` §3):

- ✅ (54 tests) → exit 0 (accept) — *1 of these is wrong: `066_BogusRecursor`*
- 🩹 / 🤷 / 🔴 (81 tests) → exit 2 (decline)
- ❌ (8 tests) → exit 1 (reject) — *all 8 are correct*

The arena cares only about (correct-accept, correct-reject, decline,
wrong-accept, wrong-reject). It will report us as 53 correct accepts, 17
correct rejects, 81 declines, 1 wrong accept (the soundness gap), 10 wrong
rejects (good tests we couldn't verify and refused to claim accept on).

## Ranked gap list

1. **~~Iota for recursors~~** ✓ **stage 1** (enums, 1-3 ctors, no params, no
   recursive args). Adds:
   - `cnames` (ordered ctor-name list)
   - `enum-rec-body`, `enum-rec-type` (structural recognizer for enum recursor
     types)
   - `defeq-extra` (closed family, no open extension allowed) + `defeq/extra`
     lift
   - 6 iota rules (one per ctor-count × position): `defeq/iota-enum-1`,
     `defeq/iota-enum-2-{first,second}`,
     `defeq/iota-enum-3-{first,second,third}`

   No trust gap: rules pattern-match on `declared` witnesses for the recursor
   and ctors, verify the recursor type fits the enum schema via
   `enum-rec-type`, and require typing premises on motive + minor premises.
   Hand-verified that Bool.rec on Bool.false fires correctly.

   Stages 2+ (first-order trees / Nat, ctors with non-recursive fields / List,
   indexed / Eq, mutual, nested) are bounded incremental rule additions — each
   follows the same pattern: extend `enum-rec-body`-style walker + per-shape
   iota rule. Tests 070/110/112 are still failing; closing them requires stage
   2 (Nat.rec on Nat.succ has recursive arg).

2. **Positivity modulo defeq** (test 048). Hits when a ctor arg type contains
   an unreduced application of a reducible def. Architectural issue: fixing it
   couples positivity to defeq.

3. **Structural eta for one-ctor inductives** (tests 096–098). Hits
   anonymous-constructor reasoning and proofs that rely on the eta law for
   records.

4. **~~Proof irrelevance~~** ✓ added (test 095 still fails —
   translator-incompleteness, the search heuristic doesn't construct
   conv-via-proof-irrel chains. The TCB rule is verified by hand-test.)

5. **K rule** (test 090). Hits dependent pattern-matching on Eq. Part of iota
   (`Eq.rec` on `Eq.refl`).

6. **Function eta** (tests 100, 101). Tests 100/101 are interesting — we have
   `defeq/eta`, so these may be translator-incompleteness, not
   TCB-incompleteness. Worth re-investigating.

7. **`t-const` level-poly congruence**. Probably rare in practice; the corpus
   may not exercise it. Worth adding for completeness but not urgent.

8. **`lvl-eq` algebraic completeness**. Bound to bite eventually. The
   eval-based decision procedure closes it wholesale.

9. **Quot's primitive rule**. No corpus test currently, but blocking for any
   real library that uses quotients (i.e., almost all of them).

10. **Mutual/nested inductives**. Deferred by choice; documented limitation.

## 6. What this means for the project plan

There are now two distinct project obligations on the TCB, with very
different costs and very different consequences for missing them:

**A. Soundness.** The TCB must not admit an env Lean would have rejected.
The arena run found exactly one such admission (`066_BogusRecursor`, §3.1).
Other tests with `expect: reject` that we currently mishandle are *declines*
(🩹), not soundness failures — the kernel refused to claim accept on them.

A separate finding (`047`, addressed in May 2026 via `string-neq`) hardened
the encoding for under-abstracted `T_HOAS` positivity attacks. That work
sets the pattern for §3.1: a translator-side construction is allowed to
*posit* facts, and the TCB's closed rules + a global audit (e.g. `%query`,
`%unique`) make a lie fatal.

**B. Completeness.** The TCB must admit every env Mario's spec admits. The
arena run quantifies the gap as 30 holes-on-good-tests + 19 generator
declines on good tests = 49 out of 93 good-tests we don't accept (47%).
This is the work the rest of this document tracks.

The pre-arena framing collapsed both into "complete the TCB" and assigned
them comparable urgency. The arena run separates them: closing §3.1 (and
auditing for other §7.3 "trusted-export" assumptions that the arena's
threat model invalidates) is a *prerequisite* for taking the kernel
seriously as a checker; completeness is a quality metric on top.

The "complete the TCB" obligation, taken alone, is finite and tractable.
The items in §5 are a finite list; ticking each off is well-defined work,
not research. Once they're all ticked, we'd have a TCB that's declaratively
complete relative to Mario's spec — meaning any Lean environment that the
spec accepts, our TCB has a proof for.

What we'd give up by not pursuing completeness: the ability to say "the
translator failing means Lean shouldn't have accepted this either". With
gaps remaining, a translator failure can mean either (a) Lean shouldn't
have accepted it, (b) we just don't have the rule, or (c) the translator
search heuristic gave up. Closing the TCB-completeness gaps reduces (b)
to ∅.

What we don't get even after closing them: a decision procedure. The
translator can still time out, give up, or fail to find a proof that exists.
That's an explicit non-goal — we're OK with handing off to a
human/LLM/external procedure in the gap. The closure of the TCB just
guarantees those handoffs are well-posed: the proof exists somewhere in the
LF signature, the question is just whether someone (us, them, something
else) can find it.

## 7. Salvaged design notes (from deleted `archive/`, May 2026)

When the `lean2lf.ts → generate-twelf.ts + prover.ts + synth.ts` refactor
landed, the old `archive/` design docs and `plugin-refactor.md` were deleted
(the refactor is done; full text in git history). These are the high-value,
still-actionable nuggets that were in them. The framework stance and a longer
soundness comparison lived in `archive/mm0-analysis.md` (vs. Carneiro's
`lean.mm1`); the level material in `archive/first-version-report.md`.

### 7.1 Level-equality decision procedure (closes §2 wholesale)

The highest-leverage `lvl-eq` fix is to port **Carneiro's algorithmic level
inequality** (Type Theory of Lean thesis, p.7): the offset relation
`ℓ ≤ ℓ' + n`, `n ∈ ℤ`, with `ℓ ≡ ℓ'` as `ℓ ≤ ℓ' + 0 ∧ ℓ' ≤ ℓ + 0`. (NB: this
is the _inference-rule_ algorithm, searchable by Twelf — **not** lean4lean's
`VLevel.LE`, which is a semantic universal-over-valuations definition and
isn't directly searchable.)

The thirteen structural rules transcribe directly into Twelf over the integer
constraint domain and were validated against `%solve` (all queries <10 ms,
including nested `imax`/`max`, commutativity, and correct _failure_ on
`1 ≤ 0`):

```twelf
mleq : level -> level -> integer -> type.
mleq/lz       : N >= 0 -> mleq lz L N.
mleq/self     : N >= 0 -> mleq L L N.
mleq/sL       : mleq L L' (N - 1) -> mleq (ls L) L' N.
mleq/sR       : mleq L L' (N + 1) -> mleq L (ls L') N.
mleq/maxR_l   : mleq L L1 N -> mleq L (lmax L1 L2) N.
mleq/maxR_r   : mleq L L2 N -> mleq L (lmax L1 L2) N.
mleq/maxL     : mleq L1 L N -> mleq L2 L N -> mleq (lmax L1 L2) L N.
mleq/imax_lzL : mleq lz L N -> mleq (limax L1 lz) L N.
mleq/imax_lsL : mleq (lmax L1 (ls L2)) L N -> mleq (limax L1 (ls L2)) L N.
mleq/imax_imL : mleq (lmax (limax L1 L3) (limax L2 L3)) L N
                  -> mleq (limax L1 (limax L2 L3)) L N.
mleq/imax_imR : mleq L (lmax (limax L1 L3) (limax L2 L3)) N
                  -> mleq L (limax L1 (limax L2 L3)) N.
mleq/imax_mxL : mleq (lmax (limax L1 L2) (limax L1 L3)) L N
                  -> mleq (limax L1 (lmax L2 L3)) L N.
mleq/imax_mxR : mleq L (lmax (limax L1 L2) (limax L1 L3)) N
                  -> mleq L (limax L1 (lmax L2 L3)) N.
```

**The one sticking point** is the fourteenth rule — universe-variable
elimination by case-split `u ↦ 0` / `u ↦ Su`. The naive HOAS transcription
(`mleq (L lz) (L' lz) N -> ({u} mleq (L (ls u)) (L' (ls u)) N) -> mleq (L U) (L' U) N`)
loops in Twelf search (`L, L' : level -> level` unify with anything).
**Recommended: Option B (hybrid).** Keep the thirteen structural rules in
Twelf; detect `imax _ U` for free `U` in TypeScript, perform the case-split
there, `%solve` each branch, and recombine via a no-op `mleq/var-discharge`
axiom (concrete levels passed in from TS, so it never fires on its own during
search). The variable-elim case is empirically rare. Net effect: replaces the
reactive `lvl-eq` rule table with a near-complete decision procedure, and also
fixes the `t-const` same-level diagonal limitation (§1.1) once levels compare
up to equivalence. The `%solve`-carries-a-side-condition pattern (already used
for `enatlit`'s `N >= 0`) is the template.

### 7.2 Name-reservation soundness check (principled fix for 124-style)

`124_dup_rec_def2` is currently rejected by a _translator-side_ pre-flight
check in `generate-twelf.ts` (a primitive recursor must be named
`<type>.rec`). The **principled, Twelf-verified** alternative — model Lean's
implicit "adding inductive `Foo` reserves the name `Foo.rec`" rule — was
validated with five Twelf spikes. Root cause: Lean generates the recursor name
fresh as `mkRecName ind = ind ++ ".rec"`, so the reservation exists no matter
what the export calls the recursor; an export naming it `original_rec` is
adversarial.

Validated LF design (deviates from the obvious sketch in 3 ways that matter):

1. **`name-kind` payloads are payload-free** (`is-declaration`, `is-rec`,
   `is-quot`) — a `string` payload inside the _kind_ puts a non-ground
   variable in `%mode name +S -K` output (Twelf can't run string
   deconcatenation). The inductive↔recursor link rides in the _string index_
   via `(N ++ ".rec")`, which Twelf evaluates forward fine.
2. **The reservation family is open with ground per-decl constants only**
   (exactly like `declared`). Generic constructors make `%unique` report a
   static overlap on every file (false positive).
3. **Reservations live in the `dkind-ok` rules with a threaded
   `{N : string}`** (forcing `N` = the `declared` name), not in the `dkind`
   constructors. The recursor (`irec`) reserves **nothing** — the inductive
   owns the `.rec` slot (`%unique` flags _any_ two constants sharing a string,
   even same-kind).

Then `dkind-ok/indt` requires both `name N is-declaration` and
`name (N ++ ".rec") is-rec`, and `final-checks.elf` adds
`%mode name +S -K. / %worlds () (name _ _). / %unique name +S -1K.` — so a
`def Foo.rec` and inductive `Foo` both reserving string `"Foo.rec"` with
different kinds make uniqueness false → ABORT. This requires repurposing
term-level `name` to `string` throughout `tcb.elf` (mechanical; generated
`.elf` already use string literals). Out of scope of the spike: forcing a
recursor's _own_ name to be `<ind>.rec` in general (needs a `+kind -string`
uniqueness in the other direction).

### 7.3 `lean.mm1` borrows + the inductive-acceptance soundness gaps

Carneiro's `lean.mm1` is a _complete_ declarative spec of the same `IsDefEq`;
where our TCB is partial it reads as a checklist. No bug found in rules we
already check; the gaps are exactly the inductive-acceptance checks §3 marks
missing/💥 — recursor well-formedness, ctor field-universe, ctor-set
exhaustiveness. These are **soundness bugs**, not incompleteness: the TCB must
perform these checks itself, and `066_BogusRecursor` / `large-elim-prop`
already exhibit inputs that exploit their absence. The same audit applies to
the two siblings below.

- **Ctor field-universe constraints** — `lean.mm1`'s `ctor_Pi` carries
  `l2 <=l l` (each field's sort ≤ the inductive's sort); `ctorR_S` carries
  `l_imax l2 l <=l l` for recursive args. We check only `defeq T T (esort U)`.
  (Our translator-side concrete-case check (d) approximates this; encoding it
  in LF removes the trust.)
- **Large-elimination / subsingleton eligibility** — `lean.mm1`'s `LE` /
  `LE_ctor` / `LE_mem` apparatus decides whether a Prop-inductive may
  eliminate into `Type`. Missing here; allowing large elimination from a
  non-subsingleton Prop is a classic route to a closed proof of `False`.
- **Recursor type well-formedness** — `lean.mm1` _synthesizes_ the recursor
  type (`Rec_*`) and checks it; we accept the export's. Our iota rules
  currently lean on the export supplying a genuine recursor rather than a
  schema-shaped lookalike.

Porting discipline (LF vs. MM0): **delete every `subst: A[e/x] = B` premise
and replace `B` with the LF application `(λx.A) e`** — MM0 reifies
substitution only because it lacks LF's meta-level β. Stance: this project
follows **Appel & Felty** (LF as proof-checking with a tiny trusted checker),
_not_ Crary–Sarkar (safety argued inside the Twelf metalogic). Keep
`%total`/`%worlds`/`%covers` off the trusted checking path; the only
legitimate metatheorem use is confidence _about_ the TCB (e.g. proving two
`lvl-eq` characterizations coincide), living outside `tcb.elf`. `%unique` and
the open-`declared` discipline are the two non-pure-LF checks we do rely on —
small decidable side-conditions, the kind a flit-style minimal LF checker
would need to add.

### 7.4 Name-usages not captured by Lean's `Declaration` (adequacy checklist)

A faithful `.render.elf` must account for names that don't appear
syntactically in the per-`Declaration` input:

1. **Quot family** — `Declaration.quotDecl` is payload-free; the kernel
   injects `Quot`/`Quot.mk`/`Quot.lift`/`Quot.ind`/`Quot.sound` with hardcoded
   types.
2. **Literal-reduction names** — `Nat`, `Nat.zero`, `Nat.succ` (+ arithmetic),
   `String`, `String.mk`, `List.nil/cons`, `Char.ofNat`, … are hardwired into
   the kernel's literal extension; none appear in the literal `Expr`.
3. **Recursors** — synthesized fresh as `Foo.rec` (lean4export does serialize
   them, so our NDJSON carries them — but the bare `Declaration` type
   doesn't).
4. **`proj typeName idx`** — needs the structure's single constructor for its
   reduction; carried today as opaque `eproj` data with no link to the names
   it depends on.
